WASHINGTON—Unable to rest their eyes on a colorful photograph or boldface heading that could be easily skimmed and forgotten about, Americans collectively recoiled Monday when confronted with a solid block of uninterrupted text.

Dumbfounded citizens from Maine to California gazed helplessly at the frightening chunk of print,
unsure of what to do next. Without an illustration, chart, or embedded YouTube
video to ease them in, millions were frozen in place, terrified
by the sight of one long, unbroken string of
English words.

"Why won't it just tell me what it's about?" said Boston resident Charlyne Thomson, who was bombarded with the overwhelming mass of black text late Monday afternoon.  "There are no bullet points, no highlighted parts. I've looked everywhere—there's nothing here but words."

"Ow," Thomson added after reading the first and last lines
in an attempt to get the gist of whatever the article,
review, or possibly recipe was about.

At 3:16 p.m., a deafening sigh was heard across the country
as the nation grappled with the daunting cascade of
syllables, whose unfamiliar letter-upon-letter structure
stretched on for an endless 500 words. Children wailed for
the attention of their bewildered parents, businesses were
shuttered, and local governments ground to a halt as
Americans scanned the text in vain for a web link to click
on.

Sources also reported a 450 percent rise in temple rubbing
and under-the-breath cursing around this time.

"It demands so much of my time and concentration," said
Chicago resident Dale Huza, who was confronted by the
confusing mound of words early Monday afternoon. "This
large block of text, it expects me to figure everything out
on my own, and I hate it."

"I've never seen anything like it," said Mark Shelton, a
high school teacher from St. Paul, MN who stared blankly at
the page in front of him for several minutes before finally
holding it up to his ear. "What does it want from us?"

As the public grows more desperate, scholars are working to randomly italicize different sections of
the text, hoping the italics will land on the important parts and allow everyone to go on with their
day. For now, though, millions of panicked and exhausted Americans continue to repetitively search
the single column of print from top to bottom and right to left, looking for even the slightest
semblance of meaning or perhaps a blurb.

Some have speculated that the never-ending flood of sentences may be a news article, medical study,
urgent product recall notice, letter, user agreement, or even a binding contract of some kind. But
until the news does a segment in which they take sections of the text and read them aloud in a slow,
calm voice while highlighting those same words on the screen, no one can say for sure.

There are some, however, who remain unfazed by the virtual
hailstorm of alternating consonants and vowels, and are
determined to ignore it.

"I'm sure if it's important enough, they'll let us know
some other way," Detroit local Janet Landsman said. "After
all, it can't be that serious. If there were anything
worthwhile buried deep in that block of impenetrable
English, it would at least have an accompanying photo of a
celebrity or a large humorous title containing a pop
culture reference."

Added Landsman, "Whatever it is, I'm pretty sure it doesn't even have a point."
